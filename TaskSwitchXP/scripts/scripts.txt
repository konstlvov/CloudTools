=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

These scripts will help you to set up some 'undocumented' TaskSwitchXP registry 
settings. Usage:
    1) close TaskSwitchXP configuration tool
    2) double-click the script in Windows Explorer or run from command line:
         >WScript //nologo JavaScript.js
    3) confirm action
    4) restart TaskSwitchXP to apply changes
    5) have fun!


1. ShowDelay Help Script
========================

When TaskSwitchXP is called, it will check if Alt+Tab is still being pressed 
after some delay. If it isn't, TaskSwitchXP will just switch to the previous 
app being used - otherwise, TaskSwitchXP will draw its own window with the 
icons, preview, etc. This script sets TaskSwitchXP show delay to 100 or 0 ms.


2. UnlockQ Help Script
======================

By default you can close selected applications by X or F4 shortcut keys. This 
script locks/unlocks Q-key for closing applications. I've written this for Luke 
Hamburg and all OS X users.


3. WheelTab Help Script
=======================

This script enables/disables Opera style task switching. This feature allows 
you to switch between tasks by mouse: simply scroll the mouse whell while 
holding the right mouse button (TaskSwitchXP will switch to the selected task 
once the right-button is released).
